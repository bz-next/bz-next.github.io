## What is it?

BZ-Next is an experimental fork of BZFlag that redoes the rendering engine from the ground-up, using modern OpenGL, and the Magnum graphics library.

See the [about the project](about) page for more information!

And check out the awesomely cross-platform [Magnum Graphics Library](https://magnum.graphics/)!

## Where can I get a copy?

BZ-Next is still in heavy development, so releases are expected to be buggy. Windows releases will be made available for download on the [Releases](releases) page. Linux users, please build from source. Instructions are found on the [Building](building) page.

## What version of OpenGL do I need?

The current goal is to aim for support for OpenGL >=2.1 and WebGL 2. Some features might only be supported on more capable platforms. Currently, the development build may not function on all platforms. Help us test it out!

## Follow development on GitHub!

You can follow development progress at [BZ-Next on GitHub](https://github.com/bz-next/bz-next). Contributions, issue reports, etc are welcome!
